== About me

Hi there, my name is Xinyu Xiang. I'm currently an undergraduate student in the #link("https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/phyen/")[Department of Physics] at Tsinghua University. I am primarily interested in the non-perturbative structure of quantum field theory and its mathematical foundations, including quantization, deformation, duality, and holography.

Beyond physics, I enjoy programming—especially writing plugins for #link("https://github.com/neovim/neovim")[Neovim]—to enhance productivity. I maintain an open-source personal configuration and several plugins on #link("https://github.com/pxwg")[GitHub].

I am also a fan of tennis, playing weekly matches with friends at the Zijing Tennis Court (紫荆网球场).

== About this blog

This blog focuses on:
- Physics and mathematical physics notes, with emphasis on non-perturbative QFT.
- Programming and tooling, including macOS internals, Neovim, and developer productivity.
- Typst usage, tips, and rendering experiments.
- Some personal stuffs.

It is built with #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tylant")[tylant], a Typst-based static site generator.
