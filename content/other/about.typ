Hi there, my name is Xinyu Xiang. I'm currently an undergraduate student in the #link("https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/phyen/")[Department of Physics] at Tsinghua University.

In the world of theoretical physics, conservation laws are omnipresent: energy, momentum, angular momentum, and charge. They form the bedrock of our physical reality.

In our daily lives, a different kind of "conservation" often prevails: the zero-sum game. Where there is a winner, there must be a loser; one's gain is another's loss. We often find ourselves encircled by these rigid constraints.

*Is there anything in our world that transcends these conservation laws?*

The answer is a resounding yes.

When I share an idea with you, it does not vanish from my mind to enter yours. Instead, it exists simultaneously in both our worlds, potentially sparking further innovation and complexity in the future. Conversely, when negative emotions are projected, they are not merely transferred but amplified between us.

In a world defined strictly by zero-sum dynamics, existence is merely a trade-off. What truly defines life is our grasp of things that are *non-conserved*.

I hope this blog serves as a vessel for that power, allowing inspiration to emerge from the "vacuum".
