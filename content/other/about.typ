Hi there, my name is Xinyu Xiang. I'm currently an undergraduate student in the #link("https://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/phyen/")[Department of Physics] at Tsinghua University.
I am primarily interested in the _non-perturbative_ structure of quantum field theory and its mathematical foundations, including quantization, deformation, duality, and holography.

Drawing on my physics studies, I aspire to use mathematical tools to provide precise descriptions of *universal properties* of the universe; and with my mathematical training, I hope to leverage physical tools to offer new insights and extensions of pure mathematical objects.

Beyond physics, I am a programming enthusiast who enjoys writing plugins for #link("https://github.com/neovim/neovim")[Neovim] (an open-source text editor) to enhance productivity, and I maintain an open-source personal configuration repository and several plugins on #link("https://github.com/pxwg")[GitHub].

I am also a fan of tennis, playing weekly matches with friends at the Zijing Tennis Court (紫荆网球场).

This site is a personal blog where I share my notes, essays, and articles. It is built with #link("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tylant")[tylant], a Typst-based static site generator.
