	abstract = {We summarise some of our recent works on \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-algebras and quasi-groups with regard to higher principal bundles and their applications in twistor theory and gauge theory. In particular, after a lightning review of \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-algebras, we discuss their Maurer-Cartan theory and explain that any classical field theory admitting an action can be reformulated in this context with the help of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. As examples, we explore higher Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory. We also explain how these ideas can be combined with those of twistor theory to formulate maximally superconformal gauge theories in four and six dimensions by means of \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-quasi-isomorphisms, and we propose a twistor space action.},
