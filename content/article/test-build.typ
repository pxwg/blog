= Testing CI Build Process

This is a minimal test post to verify that the CI testing workflow functions correctly.

The key improvements in this implementation:

1. *Test-only CI workflow* - Runs builds on test branches without deployment
2. *Font path configuration* - Downloads and configures fonts properly
3. *Environment setup* - Handles submodule initialization gracefully
4. *Debug information* - Provides visibility into font discovery process

This allows testing build success on feature branches before merging to main.
