= Idea

In quantum field theory, one could always formulate the theory (perturbatively) by Feynman diagram.
Which, briefly speaking

// The differential of graph complex could be identified with degeneration of Feynman diagram. Question: 可以将这种二者的等同理解为是 BV Lagrangian submanifold 的选取吗？

= Graph Complex

== Graph Complex of Points

== Graph Complex of Knots

== An Aside: Moduli Space of Riemann Surfaces and Graph Complex

= BV Gauge Invariant Observables

= Feynman Diagrams in AKSZ Theories
